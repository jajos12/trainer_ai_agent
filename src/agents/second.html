    h1>    <section>        <h2>1. Overview and Key Concepts</h2>        <p>AI agents
     are autonomous entities that perceive their environment and act upon it to achieve speci
    fic goals.  They are distinct from simple programs because of their ability to learn, ada
    pt, and make decisions in dynamic situations.  Key concepts include:</p>        <ul>
               <li><strong>Perception:</strong> How the agent gathers information from its en
    vironment (sensors, data streams).</li>            <li><strong>Action:</strong> How the
     agent interacts with its environment (manipulating objects, sending commands).</li>
             <li><strong>Goal:</strong> The objective the agent is trying to achieve.</li>
               <li><strong>Environment:</strong> The context in which the agent operates (phy
    sical world, simulation, digital space).</li>            <li><strong>Planning:</strong>
      The process of devising a sequence of actions to reach a goal.</li>            <li><s
    trong>Learning:</strong> The ability of the agent to improve its performance over time.</
    li>            <li><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The ability to draw conclusions and make
     inferences based on available information.</li>        </ul>        <p>Recent resear
    ch highlights the increasing sophistication of AI agents, as demonstrated by their applic
    ation in diverse fields like solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) using LLMs (Co
    dePDE), tackling complex abstract reasoning tasks (ARC-NCA), and enabling autonomous navi
    gation for UAVs (Towards Autonomous UAV Visual Object Search).</p>    </section>

     the performance of AI agents and identify areas for improvement.</li>            <li>A

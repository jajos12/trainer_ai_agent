    <body><h1>AI Agents Training</h1><section><h2>1. Overview and Key Concepts</h
    2><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) agents are autonomous entities that perceive their en
    vironment and act upon it to achieve specific goals.  Unlike traditional programs, AI age
    nts learn and adapt through experience, using various techniques like reinforcement learn
    ing, supervised learning, or a combination thereof.  They are characterized by their abil
    ity to: </p><ul>    <li><b>Perceive:</b> Gather information from their environment th
    rough sensors (e.g., cameras, sensors, APIs).</li>    <li><b>Reason:</b> Process inform
    ation and make decisions based on their goals and knowledge.</li>    <li><b>Act:</b> Ta
    ke actions in their environment to influence outcomes.</li>    <li><b>Learn:</b> Adapt
    their behavior based on feedback and experience.</li></ul><p>AI agents find applicati
    ons in diverse fields, including robotics, game playing, autonomous driving, and resource
     management.  Recent research highlights the increasing sophistication of AI agents, driv
    en by advancements in large language models (LLMs) and deep learning.</p></section>

    ollowing exercises will reinforce your understanding of AI agents:</p><div class=\"exer
    cise\"><h3>Exercise 1: Simple Grid World Agent</h3><p><b>Objective:</b> Implement a s
    imple agent that navigates a grid world to reach a goal state. </p><p><b>Instructions:<
    /b> Create a Python program that simulates a grid world with obstacles and a goal.  Imple
    ment an agent using a simple search algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search) to find a path
     to the goal.  Evaluate the agent's performance by measuring the number of steps taken to
     reach the goal.</p></div><div class=\"exercise\"><h3>Exercise 2: Q-Learning Agen
    t</h3><p><b>Objective:</b> Implement a Q-learning agent that learns to navigate a grid
    world. </p><p><b>Instructions:</b>  Extend the previous exercise to use Q-learning to t
    rain an agent.  The agent should learn the optimal policy through trial and error.  Exper
    iment with different learning rates and discount factors to observe their impact on perfo
    rmance.</p></div></section><section><h2>5. Implementation Examples</h2><p>(
